# Android_App_Test

This project attempts to simulate common soial edia programs, letting you send and recieve messaes, images and voice-mail throught a php server connected to a mysql database.

Do keep in mind this is not a secure connection, thus do not attempt to send or recieve any vital information about yourself and others.

The server must be created by the user, the php server scripts can be found on the "php" folder aling with instructions to use it.

The app itself has some debug messages that can be user to understand it better as it runs, and acan be removed safely if necessary.
